<b>This is the home page.</b> You should access this page as 
http://localhost/jsf-blank/index.jsf, not as
http://localhost/jsf-blank/index.xhtml. For this file only, you can also use 
http://localhost/jsf-blank/. If the following looks like an input form, and pressing
the button navigates to Page B, it shows that you have
correctly installed JSF 2.2. Use this project as the starting point
for your own JSF 2.2 projects, as described in the Getting Started section of the tutorial. 
See the "samples" folder for some template files.
</p>
<div align="center">
<fieldset>
<legend>JSF Test Form</legend>
<h:form>
  Some random data: <h:inputText value="#{someBean.someProperty}"/><br/>  <!-- Corresponds to getSomeProperty and setSomeProperty -->
  <!-- Calls "someActionControllerMethod" and uses return value as base name of page to navigate to. -->
  <h:commandButton value="Go to Page B" 
                   action="#{someBean.someActionControllerMethod}"/>     
</h:form>
</fieldset>
</div>
<p>
If the tags like h:form and h:commandButton are totally ignored, it probably
means that you don't have the JSF JAR file in WEB-INF/lib,  that
you haven't mapped the FacesServlet in web.xml, or  that you used the wrong URL (i.e, ending in page-a.<b>xhtml</b> instead of 
page-a.<b>jsf</b>).
</p>
<p>
Note: when making your own facelets pages (i.e., JSF .xhtml pages) in a project based on
this jsf-blank project, copy the template files from the "samples" folder to
the top-level WebContent folder, then rename the files. This is better than
than using this page directly, since this page has many extraneous entries.
